# Brain Blasts - Programming Exercises

Welcome to the Brain Blasts repository, a collection of programming exercises designed to enhance your algorithmic thinking skills. This repository follows a unique 3-step problem-solving approach to help you build a strong foundation in algorithm design. The exercises are presented in chronological order in the `exercises.js` file, embedded as comments.

## Purpose

The primary goal of Brain Blasts is to teach algorithmic thinking through carefully constructed exercises. The 3-step problem-solving approach focuses on:

1. **Solving By Hand:**
   - Understand the problem statement and solve it manually, visualizing the steps.

2. **Solving With Code:**
   - Translate the manual steps into code, capturing the logic and structure of the solution.

3. **Generalizing:**
   - Identify patterns in your solution and generalize the code to work for any input.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the exercises in `exercises.js` in chronological order from the top.
2. Follow the 3-step problem-solving approach for each exercise.
3. Engage with the provided YouTube videos for additional guidance and insights.
